# 🎛️ ASF Controls
Control your [ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm) bot from Android

## 🛠️ Setup
  - Download [HTTP Shortcuts](https://http-shortcuts.rmy.ch/)
  - Click [here](https://http-shortcuts.rmy.ch/import?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWyrrrd%2Fasf-controls%2Freleases%2Flatest%2Fdownload%2Fshortcuts.zip) to import
  - On first use, this will ask for your ASF URL, password and bot, but you can also set the variables `asf_url`, `asf_password` and `asf_bot_name` manually

## 🤲 Usage

### Toggle ASF bot
I grew annoyed that my bot threw my friends out on Steam library share when farming cards, so this turns on or off the bot.

### Update ASF
Does what it says.

### Update ASFE
As [ASFEnhance](https://github.com/chr233/ASFEnhance) updates separately from ASF and needs a restart, this handles that.
